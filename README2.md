#### Q.1 what is LCM (Least Common Multiple) ?

Def : Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers.
-Q. find LCM of 2,4,6,8,10,12?

- 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

```css
2 = 2 x 4 x 6 x 8 x 10 x 12 x 14 x 16 x 18 ...
                                               ☝️
4 = 4 x 8 x 12 x 16 x 20 x 24 x 28 x 32 x 36 ...
                           ☝️
6 = 6 x 12 x 18 x 24 x 30 x 36 x 42 x 48 x 54 ...
                  ☝️
8 = 8 x 16 x 24 x 32 x 40 x 48 x 56 x 64 x 72 ...
             ☝️


```

```css
type 1:
 Q. Find the LCM of  6  12  24  48 ?
                     x   x   x   x

 step 1 : find the bigggest number?   ==> 48
 step 2 : is every other is divide the biggest number then [ Big number ]is the [ LCM ].

```

```css
type 2:
 Q. Find the LCM of  4  12  17  24 ?
                     x   x   17*24    ==> LCM

 step 1 : find the bigggest number?   ==> 24
 step 2 : check other number divide the  [ Big number ] if yes cancal this number and now find the LCM of remaining number.

```

#### Q.2 Find the greatest number that will divide 43, 91 and 183 so as to leave the same remainder in each case?

Difference between first number and second number= 91 - 43 = 48
Difference between second number and third number = 183 - 91 = 92
Difference between third number and first number = 183 - 43 = 140
HCF of 48, 92, 140 = 4
∴ The greatest number that will divided 43, 91 and 183 so as to leave the same remainder in each case is 4.

**Writing a code, to solve a problem**
a problem can be small or big

- " जर आपल्याकडे एक big problem असेल तर...
  - तर त्याला छोट्या छोट्या parts मध्ये divide करा...
    - आता त्या छोट्या छोट्या parts ला solve करा...
      - आणि मग step by step त्याला जोडा...
        - ओ, शेठ...
          - सापडलं कि उत्तर तुम्हांला...
            - चला मग, लागा कमला."

##### You get your answer, just search properly I am updating it time to time

### Q#. You got a big Project. what to do now ?

- 1. first understand the code properly, and make a rough outline of it on paper.
- 2. make a list of all inputs given to the application.
- 3. also make a list of all outputs, the application must give this and that many types of output.
- 4. now understand which types of output and give technical names to them and make a list.
     1. now break this list into small parts means small components.
     2. now again make a list of it.
     3. now think about which part or which view or which functionality is common in multiple components.
     4. now again convent this same code in components.
     5. add this component to the last components list.
- 6. Giving numbering to these components according to complexity means required time to build them.
- 7. Now start constructing one by one component.
     1. pick the first component still is it complex make id divide it into small parts again.
     2. make an outline of this component on paper.
     3. write some algorithums loosely on how you code this component.
- 8. if you do this at last your app is ready to deploy and scale and easy to maintain.

# Python:-

## Python is case sensitive Laguage.

### Q.1 Data Types of Python?

#### Ans:

1. **Integer** : all whole numbers

```python
e.g
print(-123, 52, -782, 1)
print(2)
```

2. **Float** :decimal numbers

```python
e.g
print(-1.251, 2.584, -854.2, 0.5, 2., .7524, 23.00 )
```

3. **string** : anything inside the quots sigle or double no matters

```python
e.g
print("I am the string", "JFH525h786753", "254@$", ",;[3578*&$%$@#$%^&*][" )
```

4. **Bool** : True of False

```python
e.g
print(True)
print(False)
```

### Q.2 How to create python variables?

#### Ans:

Variable : we can assign the particular value to a partular name and this name is called variable.

Rule of creating the Variable :

1. Vriable name should start with an alphabet or "\_"
2. should not start with an number or special charactor.
3. Variable cant hav ethe space

```python
# variable
a = 2
b = 10
name = "its a variabe name"
_class_ = "THis is also a type of variable"

print(a,b)
```

### Q.3 how use input function?

### Ans:

```python
# simple input

x = input()
print("this is your input ==> ", x)

```

### Q.4 Conversions ?

### Ans:

1. from **int to string**

```python
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
print(str(n)+""+str(m))
```

2. from **string to int**

```python
n = input()
m = input()
print(int(n)+ int(m)))
```

### Q.4 Special type of Functionality?

### Ans:

1. **Type of**
